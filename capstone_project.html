        <p>
            Project Description (P2): Adversarial Machine Learning for Malware Evasion and 
Defense
This project explores the vulnerabilities of AI-based malware detection systems and develops 
robust defenses against adversarial attacks. The primary focus will be on implementing 
adversarial machine learning techniques to generate malware capable of evading detection and 
designing countermeasures to defend against such attacks. Key tasks include generating 
adversarial malware samples using techniques like FGSM and PGD while preserving 
functionality, testing detection evasion against systems like MalConv, and implementing 
defensive mechanisms such as adversarial training and robust feature extraction. Outcomes 
include a comprehensive report documenting offensive and defensive strategies, insights into 
the effectiveness of various countermeasures, and practical implementations to improve system 
robustness

        <h3 class = "subheading1"> What are AI-Based Malware Detection Systems?</h3>
        <p> AI-based malware detection systems are advanced cyber security tools
            used to detect threats to computer systems. They often use
            machine learning and deep learning models or techniques to identify these threats (<a href = "./ai.html">read more here </a>).

            There are five key features of AI Based Malware Detection Systems which differentiate them from traditional 
            Cybersecurity products, they are:

                <li> Behavioural Analysis</li>
                <li> Dynamic and Static Analysis</li>
                <li> Pattern Recognition</li>
                <li> Real-Time Detection</li>
                <li> Self Learning Adaptation</li>
            </ol>
            <!--Overview from aforementioned list-->
            <div>
                <h4> Behavioural Analysis</h4>
                <p> Behavioural Analysis refers to analysis of software in its environment.
                    The malware detection system is tasked with identifying behaviours which are 
                    abnormal for the software, such as attemps to access unauthorized files, attemps to 
                    escalated priviliges, or unusual network activity/communications.
                </p>

                <h4> Dynamic and Static Analysis </h4>
                <p> 
                    As the name suggests, in static analysis the AI models will analyse the 
                    source code associated with a program, without executing and running that said program.
                    The AI model used is usually trained against a large dataset which enables it to detect
                    vulnerabilities, logic errors or other insecure coding practices (eg SQL injection vulnerabilities)
                    The models may even identify discrepancies between comments within the code, and the associated 
                    implementation of code assocated with the comment to identify discrepancies caused by threat actors.
                    <br>
                    Conversevly, during Dynamic Analysis the software is executed and analysed during and after it execution.

                    This occurs in a sandbox enviroment, whereby the underlying hardware, file system and 
                    network of the host machine are isolated from the software being analysed, to minimised the risk
                    posed by any harmful software. 

    
                </p>

                <h4> Pattern Recognition </h4>
                <p> 
                    Pattern Recognition is a technique that enables AI Malware detection systems to 
                    detect brand new or well disguised malware, otherwise known as novel and obfuscated malware.
                    This is achieved as through pattern recognitiion, the models are trained to detect patterns
                    (for example in code or network activity) that are indicative of malware.<br>
                    The advatange of this approach, is that when a new piece of malware is developed, the specifics
                    or 'signature' of the malware is yet to be identified, documented and protected against. 
                    Pattern recognitiion can overcome this hurdle by instead identifying the unsual behaviours of the 
                    malware (eg  unusual file modification and encryptions), rather than exact matches.
                    <br>
                    Pattern recognition also plays a signification role in the detection and managedment of Obfuscated malware
                    for the same reasons. Obfuscated Malware can be expressed as 'changing it's appearance' or disguising
                    itself to avoid detection, however, the ability of pattern recognitiion to focus on the behavour of the 
                    malware rather than its specific identify makes it more likely to go undetected.
                </p>

                <h4> Real-Time Detection</h4>
                <p> 
                    Deep learning models can process vast amounts of data quickly to 
                    detect malware as it emerges, reducing response time.
                </p>


                <h4> Self Learning Adaptation </h4>
                <p> These systems continuously improve by learning from new malware 
                    samples and evolving attack techniques.</p>
            </div>

        <h2 class = "subheading1"> What is Adversarial Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>
            Adversarial Machine learning is a group of techniques and skills that are used to manipulate machine learning models in order to trick and decieve the models. This is generally
            achieved by providing an input to the model that has been specifically designed to cause incorrect classification or predictions. In most cases, this is achieved by making slight
            changes to the original data which can go unnoticed at first, but then cause errors to the models behaviour

            Adversarial Machine Learning can be divided into two main categories:
